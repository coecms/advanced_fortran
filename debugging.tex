    \frametitle{Tracing}
    Tracing is the simplest form of evaluating the execution.

    Basically it means a lot of statements like

    \begin{lstlisting}
        print *, "Been here, value of X is ", X
    \end{lstlisting}

    While it is very easy to execute, it requires a lot of code changes and recompiles.

    Plus, at the end you have to remove all the \texttt{print} statements again.

    \frametitle{Advanced Debugging}
    Debugging is an Art Form.

    There are several tools available to help, I'll showcase a few examples:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stack Trace
        \item Run Time Checks
        \item Debugger
    \end{itemize}

    This concludes this short chapter on debugging.

    Any questions so far?
